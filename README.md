## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
  - Get Weather data of their current location
  - search for any location through a search bar
  - Switch between Farenheit and Celsius units
  - Refresh data


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessor
- [PrimeNg Components](https://primeng.org/) - For styles


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - Angular documentation helped me a lot when working with projects, and needed to know how a specific feature was used, and the best way to use it.
